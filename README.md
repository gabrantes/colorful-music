## Colors To Sounds
This project deals with converting colors to sounds. The hue of the color affects the frequency of the sound, while the lightness affects how a special flanger effect is applied to the sound.

We apply our function in two ways: with image and with colors.

## Play With Image
Upload an image. The three most dominant colors in the image are determined. Each of those colors is converted into a sound wave, and the three resulting sound waves are played simultaneously as a chord.

## Play With Colors
Use the mouse to click anywhere on our rainbow gradient. The color underneath the mouse is converted into a sound wave, and that sound wave is played.
